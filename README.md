# Inspiration

It was our online mode of study and the related difficulties in socializing that inspired us to make this bot so that we could rekindle our memories and discuss things about our lives that help us know each other better.

# What we learnt

We learnt how a Slack Bot is made using the Bolt-JS framework and also, how we can use it to connect to a variety of APIs on the internet to allow expansion of functionality.

# Rekindling Connections

1. Allows users to play games on slack channels
2. Used Nodejs and bolt framework
3. Low community help in configuring the bolt framework
4. Built our own slack app!
5. Nodejs, backend development, JavaScript, Express

# Challenges faced

We faced some challenges which include configuring some things, but overall the experience was great.


# To create a server for our bot
ngrok http -host-header=rewrite localhost:3000
